###### Last update: 23/8/21 dbe - final v1

## Summary  
The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to get you started using Python and Jupyter Notebooks for routine chemical engineering calculations. This introduction assumes this is your first exposure to Python or Jupyter notebooks.

- **Step 0: Gain Executable Access to Jupyter Notebooks** 

Jupyter notebooks are documents that can be viewed and executed inside any modern web browser. Since you're reading this notebook, you already know how to view a Jupyter notebook. The next step is to learn how to execute computations that may be embedded in a Jupyter notebook.
</br>
To execute Python code in a notebook you will need access to a Python kernal. A kernal is simply a program that runs in the background, maintains workspace memory for variables and functions, and executes Python code. The kernal can be located on the same laptop as your web browser or located in an on-line cloud service.

Important Note Regarding Versions There are two versions of Python in widespread use. Version 2.7 released in 2010, which was the last release of the 2.x series. Version 3.5 is the most recent release of the 3.x series which represents the future direction of language. It has taken years for the major scientific libraries to complete the transition from 2.x to 3.x, but it is now safe to recommend Python 3.x for widespread use. So for this course be sure to use latest verstion, currently 3.6, of the Python language.
